/*
   what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer

// synchronous:Sometimes it causes problems and confusion in the execution of codes

// asynchronous:it creates order in the execution of codes and causes many codes to be created in order

// Asynchronous functions allow JavaScript to execute other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete, enabling non-blocking behavior.
// Commonly achieved with callbacks, promises, or async/await.
